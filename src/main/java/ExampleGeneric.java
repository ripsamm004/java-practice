    Java Generics Bounded Type Parameters
Suppose we want to restrict the type of objects that can be used in the parameterized type,
for example in a method that compares two objects and we want to make sure that the accepted
objects are Comparables. To declare a bounded type parameter, list the type parameterâ€™s name,
followed by the extends keyword, followed by its upper bound, similar like below method.
