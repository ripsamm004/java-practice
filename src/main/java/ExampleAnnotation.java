 * Java Custom Annotation

 Creating custom annotation in java is similar to writing an interface, except that it interface keyword is prefixed with @ symbol. We can declare methods in annotation.

 Java Annotations allow us to add metadata information into our source code, al

 The @Inherited annotation signals that a custom annotation used in a class should be inherited by all of its sub classes. For example:

 @Retention

 It indicates how long annotations with the annotated type are to be retained.
